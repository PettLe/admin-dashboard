Final stretch of the HTML/CSS fullstack part 1.
The goal of this project is to recreate Admin Dashboard design provided.
The main focus will be using Grid and not relying too much on Flexbox.

After creating the basic layout my (optimistic) prediction is that this project is going to be fairly easy.

Finished. Took longer than expected, mostly because this project felt kinda drag. Something I just wanted to be over with and move on.
No major issues. Of course the code is ugly and there's not so clever choices been made, but overall it's good enough for me.
I didn't EXACTLY copy every little aspect. It would have been nightmare.

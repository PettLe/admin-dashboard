Final stretch of the HTML/CSS fullstack part 1.
The goal of this project is to recreate Admin Dashboard design provided.
The main focus will be using Grid and not relying too much on Flexbox.

After creating the basic layout my (optimistic) prediction is that this project is going to be fairly easy.
